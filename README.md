**Gallery App with React and Node.js**


This is a simple gallery app built with React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend. The app allows users to add, view, update, and delete gallery items, each containing a title, image URL, and description.

Prerequisites
Before getting started, you need to have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js: Download and install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org
Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project and run the gallery app:

**Clone the repository:**


git clone https://github.com/RBK-TN/RBKTN-KEF-01-23-Gallery-App.git
cd client
Install Dependencies:

In the project root directory, install the dependencies for both the frontend and backend:


cd client
npm install
cd ../server
npm install
Start the Backend Server:

In the backend directory, start the Node.js backend server:


npm start
The server should now be running on http://localhost:5000.

Start the Frontend React App:

In the frontend directory, start the React app:


**npm start**
The React app should open in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

**Features**
The gallery app allows you to perform the following actions:

Add a new gallery item with a title, image URL, and description.
View all gallery items displayed in a grid.
Update the details (title, image URL, description) of an existing gallery item.
Delete a gallery item.
Folder Structure
The project has the following folder structure:

gallery-app/
├── frontend/              // Frontend (React) code
│   ├── public/            // Public files (favicon, index.html, etc.)

│   └── ...
└── backend/               // Backend (Node.js with Express) code
    ├── app.js             // Express server code
 
 
    └── ...
**Further Improvements**
This is a basic version of the gallery app. You can further improve it by implementing features like user authentication, image uploads, pagination, filtering, and using a database (instead of an in-memory array) to store gallery items.

**Troubleshooting**
If you encounter any issues or errors while setting up or running the app, feel free to ask for help or refer to the official documentation of Node.js, Express, and React.
